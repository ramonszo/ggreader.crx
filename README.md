## A user script that turns Feedly into a Google Reader clone.
Google discontinued Google Reader on July 1st 2013. I went outside to find an alternative, then I found Feedly.

Feedly is good service that has everything I need, including mobile versions, social tools and more. But yeah, their interface is not that clean as Google Reader, that's why I made GGReader.


## Discontinuing GGReader
Since Feedly became the major RSS reader, I decided to end the extension support. 

If you still miss Google Reader, feel free to create a fork! :)


## As seen on
I don't know why this extension get so many downloads (thank you!), but I think these blogs helped a lot:
